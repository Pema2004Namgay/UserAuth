# UserAuth
Explanation
The practical started with installing important packages like express, pg, dotenv, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, nodemailer, and others, as well as configuring the required dependencies using npm. We have used MVC framework for designing a modular directory structure that divided concerns among controllers, models, views, and routes. Using SQL queries inside a function in the userModel.js file, a PostgreSQL table called users was developed and generated for the model.  This table has the following fields: id, username, email, password, role, is_verified, and tokens for email and password verification.   In a separate db.js file, the database connection is specified via environment variables for security reasons.

All of the fundamental logic is managed by the authentication controller (authController.js). The user's password is safely hashed using bcryptjs during registration (signup), and a verification token is produced using jsonwebtoken. A verification link is included in an email sent to the user using nodemailer; clicking the link changes the user's status to is_verified = true.  The login feature makes sure the email is validated and the user's credentials are valid before allowing access. Users can request a reset link to get their password back, and it will be sent to the email address they registered. Clicking on the link will take them to a form where they can change their password.  

EJS templates are used to render the front end, which has distinct views for the landing page, login, signup, forgotten password, and reset password. These views make use of forms that POST data to the appropriate channels. It links to a basic CSS stylesheet to give a consistent and fine user interface across all views. Express and certain authRoutes are used for routeing. Every user-related GET and POST request is specified in the js file. Static file handling, session and cookie middleware, view engine setup, and, lastly, initialising the PostgreSQL table at startup to guarantee the user table exists are all included in the server configuration in app.js.
